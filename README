It runs both tests by launching the single 'flake8' script, and also adds a 
few features:

- lines that contains a "# NOQA" comment at the end will not issue a warning
- more things to come..

Original projects:

- pep8: http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/
- PyFlakes: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes
