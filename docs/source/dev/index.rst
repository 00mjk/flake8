 Writing Plugins for Flake8
============================

Since Flake8 2.0, the Flake8 tool has allowed for extensions and custom
plugins. In Flake8 3.0, we're expanding that ability to customize and
extend **and** we're attempting to thoroughly document it. Some of the
documentation in this section will reference third-party documentation
to reduce duplication and to point you, the developer, towards
the authoritative documentation for those pieces.
