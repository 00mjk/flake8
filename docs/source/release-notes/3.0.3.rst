3.0.3 -- 2016-07-28 (unreleased)
--------------------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Fix ``# noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab#178`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab#195`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab#164`_)
