3.0.0 -- Unreleased
-------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore 
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for 
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.
